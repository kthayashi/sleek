 Last month I started working towards a Ph.D. in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/) at UCLA! For the next 5 years or so I will conduct research as a member of Dr. Nathan Kraft's [Plant Community Ecology Lab](https://sites.lifesci.ucla.edu/eeb-kraft/). The Kraft Lab integrates aspects of community ecology, biogeography, ecophysiology, and phylogenetics to study species coexistence, plant responses to climate change, the distribution of diversity at broad spatial scales, and the assembly of regional biotas.

 I am broadly interested in understanding the processes underlying the coexistence, community assembly, and geographic distributions of plant species. At present, I am particularly interested in studying how different fundamental ecological processes (e.g. niche selection, ecological drift) interact to shape plant communities along ecological gradients and across spatial scales. I am also interested in studying the influence of regional processes, such as the size and taxonomic or functional composition of species pools, on local coexistence dynamics. I eventually hope to link my research to aspects of plant species' geographic distributions and range shifts. I am currently planning on working primarily in the annual grasslands of California.

 Stay tuned as my research program develops!
