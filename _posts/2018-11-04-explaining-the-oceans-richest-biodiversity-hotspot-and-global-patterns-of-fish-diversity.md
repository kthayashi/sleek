My first co-authored scientific paper <a href="https://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/285/1888/20181314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Explaining the ocean's richest biodiversity hotspot and global patterns of fish diversity"</a> was published in *Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences* on October 10, 2018. This study was led by <a href="https://elizabethcmiller.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liz Miller</a> (University of Arizona), who has been an amazing academic mentor to me from when I was an undergraduate student. The study received coverage by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/science/coral-reef-biodiversity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/secret-behind-coral-reef-diversity-time-lots-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UA News</a>. I also contributed a <a href="https://obis.org/2018/10/18/evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> for <a href="https://www.obis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OBIS (Ocean Biogeographic Information System)</a> summarizing the study and describing our usage of OBIS data.

Marine biodiversity is highest in the Central Indo-Pacific region and declines with distance from this hotspot. Although a multitude of ecological and evolutionary factors can influence the number of species found in a region, differences in regional species richness are ultimately the result of only three fundamental evolutionary processes: speciation, extinction, and colonization events. In this study, we investigated how the timing and rates of these processes have shaped global species richness patterns in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percomorpha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">percomorph fishes</a>, a group comprising >70% of marine fish species. To do this, we combined data on the geographic distributions of >17,000 percomorphs compiled from <a href="https://www.obis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OBIS</a>, <a href="https://www.gbif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GBIF</a>, <a href="http://www.fishbase.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FishBase</a>, and <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IUCN</a> with an extensive <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time-calibrated phylogeny</a> in order to reconstruct the biogeographic history across this phylogeny and to compute diversification rates.

Our analyses resulted in three main findings. First, we found that regions with more net time for lineages to diversify there as a result of relatively older and/or more frequent colonizations had higher species richness. The Central Indo-Pacific in particular experienced many relatively old colonization events 34 to 5.3 million years ago, thereby allowing more species richness to build up over time compared to other marine regions. Second, diversification rates were uncoupled from present-day species richness patterns. In fact, we found that diversification rates were highest in high-latitude cold oceans, consistent with findings of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0273-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another recent study</a>. Third, unlike in marine regions, we found that the high diversity of freshwater fishes was explained by few ancient transitions from marine to freshwater habitats coupled with elevated diversification rates.

Overall, this study provides an explanation for the high fish diversity of the Central Indo-Pacific region. It also adds to the increasing number of cases illustrating that the timing and rates of macroevolutionary processes can interact to shape large-scale biodiversity patterns. We conclude by noting that our results reflect the geologic history of the global oceans, and thus may also apply to other groups of marine organisms.

My participation in this project was supported initially by a <a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/index.php?q=link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrownConnect LINK Award</a>, which allowed me, as an undergraduate student at Brown University, to travel to the University of Arizona during the summer of 2016 to work on the project. Although the focus of my personal research has since shifted to plant community ecology, the topic and approach of this project are things that I still like thinking about, and working on this project has undoubtedly been an important part of my academic development.
